# Netflix-Recommendation-System

## Overview
The Netflix Recommendation System is a project aimed at developing a personalized recommendation system for the Netflix streaming platform. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and provide personalized movie and TV show recommendations.

## Features
1. User Profiling: The system creates user profiles by analyzing their viewing history, ratings, and interactions with the platform.
2. Content Analysis: The system analyzes the attributes of movies and TV shows, such as genre, cast, director, and user ratings, to understand the content.
3. Collaborative Filtering: The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to recommend content based on user behavior and preferences. It identifies similar users and suggests content that those users have enjoyed.
4. Content-Based Filtering: The system uses content-based filtering techniques to recommend content based on the attributes of the items themselves. It identifies items similar to those the user has enjoyed in the past.
5. Hybrid Recommendations: The system combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide hybrid recommendations that leverage both user behavior and item attributes.
6. Real-Time Updates: The system continuously updates user profiles and recommendations based on the user's interactions and feedback.
7. Scalability: The system is designed to handle a large number of users and items efficiently, ensuring fast and accurate recommendations even as the user base and content library grow.

## Usage
1. Upon running the recommendation system, it will start analyzing user behavior and generating personalized recommendations.
2. Users can provide feedback on recommended items, such as ratings or likes/dislikes, which the system will use to refine future recommendations.
3. Users can explore recommended items based on their personalized recommendations and watch the suggested content directly on the Netflix platform.
